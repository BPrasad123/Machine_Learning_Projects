# Churn Prediction

This is a project to predict the churn in an organization. 

Key Points:
1. Clean data has been used as input
2. Models used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVM
3. GridSearchCV has been used for hyperparameter optimization
4. Pipeline has been used for ease of model execution and finding the best performing model based on accurracy.

Disclaimer: Pipeline related code has been inspired by Matthew Mayo's blog on KDNuggests.

Code: Churn_Prediction.py
